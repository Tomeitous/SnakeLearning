Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. In RL, an agent takes actions to achieve a goal and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

The objective of the agent is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. The agent does this by exploring the environment, trying out different actions, and learning from the feedback received.

Key components of reinforcement learning:

- **Agent**: The decision-maker that interacts with the environment.
- **Environment**: The world in which the agent operates and takes actions.
- **State**: A representation of the current situation of the agent in the environment.
- **Action**: The choices the agent can make to interact with the environment.
- **Reward**: The feedback signal that the agent receives after taking an action, which can be positive or negative.
- **Policy**: A strategy that the agent follows to determine which action to take in a given state.

Reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are designed to help the agent learn the optimal policy by updating its knowledge based on the feedback it receives from the environment.

Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to various domains, including game playing, robotics, and recommendation systems.
