# My Thoughts and Involvement in the Project

## Project Idea
The project idea was to create a Snake game using reinforcement learning. It was a great opportunity to combine my interest in game development and machine learning.

## Time Spent and Grade
I spent approximately 25 hours on this project and believe the project deserves a grade of 4.5-5 out of 5.

## Difficulty
The difficulty of the project was around 7 out of 10. It was challenging but not overwhelming.

## What I Learned
Throughout the project, I learned about Python, game creation, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and machine learning in general.

## Bugs and Challenges
There were a few bugs encountered during the project, such as the snake sometimes going through itself and some issues with the obstacles. Additionally, the snake game with obstacles is still a work in progress.

## Positive Aspects
The snake learned to play the game quite quickly, which was very exciting and rewarding to see.

## Areas for Improvement
There is still room for improvement, such as enhancing the snake's learning process since it seems to halt after a while.

## Next Steps
The next step would be to add more features and challenges to the game, making it more engaging and providing the snake with new learning experiences.

## Personal Reflection
I spent around 30% of my time creating the snake game and 70% on the deep learning code. This project was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to explore the intersection of game development and machine learning. It was fascinating to see how the snake agent improved its gameplay over time, and I'm eager to continue working on this project and see how far I can push its capabilities.
